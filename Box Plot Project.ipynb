    "<h3>The History of the Box Plot</h3>\n",
    "<p>Box-and-whisker plot, also called boxplot or box plot, graph that summarizes numerical data based on quartiles, which divide a data set into fourths. The box-and-whisker plot is useful for revealing the central tendency and variability of a data set, the distribution (particularly symmetry or skewness) of the data, and the presence of outliers. It is also a powerful graphical technique for comparing samples from two or more different treatments or populations. It was invented in the 1970s by American statistician John Wilder Tukey.\n",

    "<p>The box plot, sometimes known as a 'boxplot' or 'box and whiskers plot', is a graph that depicts numerical datasets based on quartiles. To create a box plot from a dataset, the creator must identify the following:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul><li>The median value</li>\n",
    "<li>Two hinges - the first and third quartile value</li>\n",
    "<li>Upper and lower whiskers - Maximum and minimum values that aren't outliers</li>\n",
    "<li>Any potential out-liers - those individual points further away from the median than the extremes</li></ul>\n",
