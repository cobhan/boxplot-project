    "<h3>The History of the Box Plot</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The box plot, sometimes known as a 'boxplot' or 'box and whiskers plot', is a graph that depicts numerical datasets based on quartiles. It was invented in the 1970s by the American statistician John Wilder Tukey and can be used to identify if a distribution is skewed and whether whether or not there are any outliers.  To create a box plot from a dataset, the creator must identify the following:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul><li>The median value</li>\n",
    "<li>Two hinges - the first and third quartile value</li>\n",
    "<li>Upper and lower whiskers - Maximum and minimum values that aren't outliers</li>\n",
    "<li>Any potential out-liers - those individual points further away from the median than the extremes</li></ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Example box plot:</p>\n",
    "<div><p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Michelsonmorley-boxplot.svg\" align=\"left\"></p></div>\n",
    "<br clear=\"all\" />\n",
    "<p>Box plots are useful in the following situations:</p>\n",
    "<ul><li><strong>Comparison of multiple datasets.</strong> Box plots immediately highlight differences between center, spread, and range of different datasets.</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>Summarizing data.</strong> Box plots are ideal for quickly summarizing datasets - and because they only focus on key data points, they can easily handle large datasets.</li>\n",
    "<li><strong>Identifying outliers.</strong> Outliers can be the most interesting points in a dataset. Even if the outlier turns out to be unimportant, the outlier will, at the very least, deserve some level of further investigation. An outlier on a boxplot are datapoints which lie beyond the quartiles by one-and-a-half times the interquartile range can be classed as potential outliers.</li></ul>\n"
